# scholarIt
If you write the following text in your command prompt, you can search your search word with Google Scholar. <br>
\>python scholarIT.py <I>serach word</I><br>
If you want to search as phrase, please put your search word between two <I>%22</I>, that means double quatation.<br>
You can use only English as the search word for now. Please wait for dealing with other languages.<br>

I plan to extend the function of this file, but it has limited function so far. I am really sorry.
